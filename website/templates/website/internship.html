                    the COVID virus outbreak. People have had time to reflect on themselves. But it has been found that
                    many have had psychotic breakdowns and have needed help from professionals to get their minds
                    back to their normal lives. So the help of psychologists has never been needed more than now. Your
                    Friend provides help with RCI licensed clinical psychologists with immense experience and in-depth
                    knowledge of mental health issues.
                    Your Friend requires interns who can learn and work under their supervision. This is an opportunity
                    like no other for college students and graduates to get hands-on experience by getting a chance to
                    work under professionals directly
                    helping them in their career development. Your Friend does not only provide a platform for
                    Psychology students only, but we also respect diversity and are providing opportunities to students
                    in different fields. Students who want
                    their first steps in the industry and also care for people can join Your Friends as interns. We
                    provide not only internship under psychiatrists but also with Human Resource, Content Writing,
                    Graphic Designing and much more. Be
                    a part of Your Friends and develop your professional skills.Mail us at<br><br></p>
